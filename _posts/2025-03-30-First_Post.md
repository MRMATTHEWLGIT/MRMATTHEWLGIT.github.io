# My First Blog Post

Hello I'm Matthew Lockett and this is my first blog post. I have started this blog due to being tasked the challenge of making one within my Computer Vision and Deep Learning course, ELEC4630, whilst studying at The University of Queensland. The fastai `fast_template` was used to get this blog up and running in no time, and made it simple to get this first post written. I look forward to continuing to write more posts, hopefully even beyond the current course that I am taking at Uni.
