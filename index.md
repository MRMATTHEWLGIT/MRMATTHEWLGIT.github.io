# My Blog
I'm a fifth year student at The University of Queensland (UQ) and I am currently studying a dual degree in a Bachelor of Engineering specialising in Mechatronics / Bachelor of Computer Science majoring in Machine Learning. I originally started this blog for an assignment in my Computer Vision and Deep Learning course, ELEC4630, whilst at UQ.
